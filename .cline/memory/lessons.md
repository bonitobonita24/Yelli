## BOOTSTRAP — 🔴 WSL2 + Docker Desktop known pitfalls

- Type: 🔴 gotcha
- Phase: Phase 0 Bootstrap / Phase 1 dev environment open
- Files: .env.dev, docker-compose.\*.yml, .nvmrc
- Concepts: wsl2, docker-desktop, pnpm, nvm, permissions
- Narrative: Real failures on WSL2 + Docker Desktop. All fixes baked into Bootstrap template.
  (1) Never use corepack enable — use npm install -g pnpm. corepack symlinks fail in some WSL2 setups.
  (2) pnpm install must run from WSL2 terminal — not Windows PowerShell or CMD.
  (3) Docker Desktop must be running before any docker compose command. Check with: docker ps.
  (4) Port conflicts: dev services use non-standard random ports (Rule 22). If conflict occurs,
  regenerate ports in inputs.yml → run Phase 7 → restart services.
  (5) nvm must be sourced in .bashrc — add: [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
  (6) WSL2 file permissions: always develop inside WSL2 filesystem (/home/user/) not /mnt/c/.
  Working in /mnt/c/ causes severe pnpm and docker performance issues.

## 2026-05-12 — 🟤 a11y-skill skipped — coverage redundant via active skills

- Type: 🟤 decision
- Phase: Phase 4 Part 1 → Part 2 transition
- Files: docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md
- Concepts: a11y, wcag, accessibility, skills, plugin-install, redundancy
- Narrative: airowe/claude-a11y-skill has no valid SKILL.md (npx install clones but finds nothing).
  /plugin install a11y-skill not in any marketplace. Decision: skip the dedicated skill.
  WCAG AA enforcement remains intact via 5 overlapping layers: (1) design-auditor active skill —
  17 professional rules including WCAG, contrast, typography, scores /100; (2) frontend-design —
  Anthropic quality bar with focus rings, ARIA, keyboard nav; (3) ui-ux-pro-max — 99 UX guidelines;
  (4) oiloil-ui-ux-guide — HCI laws; (5) Phase 2.6 will auto-embed WCAG 2.1 AA enforcement block
  in design-system/MASTER.md because inputs.yml accessibility.level = wcag_aa, plus Vercel Web
  Interface Guidelines. Future sessions: do NOT re-attempt a11y-skill install — coverage exists.
  If a dedicated skill becomes available with valid SKILL.md, evaluate then.
