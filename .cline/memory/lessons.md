## BOOTSTRAP — 🔴 WSL2 + Docker Desktop known pitfalls
- Type:      🔴 gotcha
- Phase:     Phase 0 Bootstrap / Phase 1 dev environment open
- Files:     .env.dev, docker-compose.*.yml, .nvmrc
- Concepts:  wsl2, docker-desktop, pnpm, nvm, permissions
- Narrative: Real failures on WSL2 + Docker Desktop. All fixes baked into Bootstrap template.
  (1) Never use corepack enable — use npm install -g pnpm. corepack symlinks fail in some WSL2 setups.
  (2) pnpm install must run from WSL2 terminal — not Windows PowerShell or CMD.
  (3) Docker Desktop must be running before any docker compose command. Check with: docker ps.
  (4) Port conflicts: dev services use non-standard random ports (Rule 22). If conflict occurs,
      regenerate ports in inputs.yml → run Phase 7 → restart services.
  (5) nvm must be sourced in .bashrc — add: [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
  (6) WSL2 file permissions: always develop inside WSL2 filesystem (/home/user/) not /mnt/c/.
      Working in /mnt/c/ causes severe pnpm and docker performance issues.
